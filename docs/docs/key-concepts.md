# Key Concepts

FlowMaestro is built around a few core concepts that work together to create powerful automations.

## Workflows

**Workflows** are visual automations built on a canvas. They consist of connected nodes that process data step-by-step.

## Agents

**Agents** are AI-powered assistants that can hold conversations, remember context, and execute tools. Unlike workflows, agents can make decisions dynamically.

## Triggers

**Triggers** are events that start your automations:

- **Webhooks** — HTTP requests from external systems
- **Schedules** — Time-based execution (cron)
- **Events** — Platform events like new messages or orders

## Integrations

**Integrations** connect FlowMaestro to external services. Each integration provides operations you can use in workflows and agents.

## Knowledge Bases

**Knowledge Bases** let you upload documents that your agents can search and reference. Perfect for building assistants with custom knowledge.
