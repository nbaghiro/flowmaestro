# Agents

Agents are AI-powered assistants that can hold conversations, remember context, and take actions.

## Agents vs Workflows

| Feature   | Workflows              | Agents                        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Execution | Linear, predictable    | Dynamic, AI-driven            |
| State     | Stateless              | Maintains conversation memory |
| Control   | You define every step  | AI decides what to do         |
| Best for  | Repeatable automations | Conversational interfaces     |

## Key Capabilities

| Capability        | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Conversations** | Natural language chat with context retention   |
| **Memory**        | Remember previous interactions and facts       |
| **Tools**         | Execute actions via integrations and workflows |
| **Knowledge**     | Access your uploaded documents                 |

## How Agents Work

1. **User sends a message** to the agent
2. **Agent processes** the message with its AI model
3. **Agent decides** whether to respond or take action
4. **If action needed**, agent calls tools (integrations, workflows)
5. **Agent responds** with the final answer

## Use Cases

- **Customer Support** — Answer questions using your knowledge base
- **Sales Assistant** — Qualify leads and book meetings
- **Internal Helper** — Look up information and perform tasks
- **E-commerce Bot** — Check orders and handle returns
