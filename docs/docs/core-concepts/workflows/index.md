# Workflows

Workflows are the foundation of FlowMaestro. They let you build automations visually by connecting nodes on a canvas.

## What is a Workflow?

A workflow is a series of connected steps that execute in sequence. Each step is a **node** that performs a specific action — like calling an API, transforming data, or making a decision.

## Key Features

| Feature                 | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Visual Canvas**       | Drag-and-drop interface for building automations |
| **Real-time Execution** | Watch your workflow run step-by-step             |
| **Error Handling**      | Built-in retry logic and error recovery          |
| **Version History**     | Track changes and rollback when needed           |

## Workflow Components

Every workflow consists of:

1. **Trigger** — What starts the workflow
2. **Nodes** — Individual steps that process data
3. **Edges** — Connections that define execution order
4. **Variables** — Data that flows between nodes
