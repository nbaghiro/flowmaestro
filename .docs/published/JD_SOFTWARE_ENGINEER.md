## Job Posting

### Senior Software Engineer

**About FlowMaestro**

We're building the platform that makes AI automation accessible to everyone. FlowMaestro combines visual workflow orchestration with autonomous AI agents, letting developers and non-technical users build sophisticated AI-powered automations without deep infrastructure knowledge.

Our users build everything from customer support routing to multi-step approval workflows, RAG pipelines to lead enrichment systems—all through our visual builder or programmatic APIs.

**What you'll work on**

- **Workflow Engine** — Build and extend our 20+ node types that power workflows: LLM calls, database operations, HTTP requests, file processing, conditional logic, and loops
- **AI Agents** — Develop our agent system including memory management (buffer, summary, vector), tool execution, and multi-turn conversations
- **Integrations** — Expand our 100+ integration catalog, building OAuth flows and provider SDKs that work seamlessly with both workflows and agents
- **Real-time Systems** — WebSocket events, SSE streaming for token-by-token LLM responses, and live execution monitoring
- **Developer Experience** — SDKs (TypeScript, Python), CLI tools, and public APIs that our users love

**Our stack**

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Flow, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Fastify, Node.js 22, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Redis, Temporal
- **AI**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere — unified interface across all providers
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, GCP, Pulumi, OpenTelemetry

**What we're looking for**

- 5+ years building production software
- Strong TypeScript skills (we use strict mode everywhere—no `any` types)
- Deep experience across the stack: React frontends, Node.js backends, PostgreSQL
- You've shipped features end-to-end—from database schema to UI polish
- Experience with AI/ML or LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
- Product mindset: you think about user problems, not just code
- Comfortable making technical decisions and owning outcomes

**Even better if you have**

- Experience with workflow orchestration (Temporal, Airflow, Prefect)
- Built integrations with third-party APIs (OAuth flows, webhooks, rate limiting)
- Kubernetes and infrastructure-as-code (Pulumi, Terraform)
- Real-time systems (WebSockets, SSE, streaming)
- Contributed to or built developer tools, SDKs, or APIs

**What we offer**

- Early-stage equity in a rapidly growing space
- Remote-first culture with async communication
- Work on meaningful problems at the intersection of AI and developer tools
- Small team where your work has outsized impact
