# Workspace Migration Job
# Creates personal workspaces for existing users who don't have one.
# This job is created with a unique name per deployment.
# The ${TIMESTAMP} and ${IMAGE_TAG} placeholders are replaced by sed during deployment.
#
# Usage:
#   # From local script (migrate-workspaces.sh):
#   TIMESTAMP=$(date +%s)
#   sed "s/\${TIMESTAMP}/$TIMESTAMP/g; s/\${IMAGE_TAG}/latest/g" \
#     infra/k8s/jobs/workspace-migration.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
