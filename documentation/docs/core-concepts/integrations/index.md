# Integrations

Connect FlowMaestro to your favorite tools.

## How Integrations Work

1. **Connect** — Authenticate with OAuth or API key
2. **Configure** — Select which accounts/resources to access
3. **Use** — Add integration nodes to workflows or tools to agents

## Integration Types

### OAuth Integrations

Most integrations use OAuth for secure authentication:

- Click "Connect" to authorize
- Grant specific permissions
- Tokens managed automatically

### API Key Integrations

Some integrations use API keys:

- Enter your API key in settings
- Keys stored securely encrypted

## Managing Connections

From the **Connections** page:

- View all connected accounts
- Add new connections
- Reconnect expired authorizations
- Remove connections

:::warning
Removing a connection will break any workflows using that integration.
